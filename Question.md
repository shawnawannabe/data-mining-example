Questions:
1. Select and download Covid-19 related data for analysis from one or more of the
following data sources:
a) https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset
b) https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
c) https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus
d) https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge
e) or other country level data sources
2. Explore the dataset(s) you have selected using some software packages in the
Scientific Python Data Science stack (e.g. numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib etc.).
3. Youâ€™ll explore the data, transform it, and visualize it, creating key data visualizations similar to those seen by John Hopkins University
(https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40
299423467b48e9ecf6), NYTimes (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/21/upshot/coronavirus-deaths-bycountry.html) and in the Financial Times (https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest).
4. Write Python program to gain some insights into the dataset? Which countries outside
of China have been hit hardest? When will (some places) achieve 0 new cases?
5. Some insights could be
- changes in number of confirmed cases over time
- change in cases over time at country level
- latest number of confirmed cases throughout the world
- Malaysia (or any other country) compared to the rest of the world
- which countries have been hit hardest? hardest hit countries as of now (or over
certain period of time) etc.
6. You are to decide and design what insight you would like to gain from the raw
dataset(s).
7. You are only expected to do up to visualization and analysis in this project. You are
NOT required to perform forecasting based on the dataset(s) (but if you can, why not?)
8. Write an interesting interface in the Python program to demonstrate your analysis
results. You may visually display the result using Python visual plot library such as
matplotlib, ggplot2 etc.
